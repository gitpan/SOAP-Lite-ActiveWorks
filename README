Highlights
==========

    *  Use your ActiveWorks broker as a SOAP server.
    *  HTTP SOAP server and ActiveWorks SOAP servers forward requests
       to each other.
    *  Publish ActiveWorks events from Linux!  (ala SOAP of course)


Overview
========

SOAP::Transport::ACTIVEWORKS module provides a transport layer for sending and
receiving SOAP requests to and from an ActiveWorks broker.  Example adapter and
client scripts are provided.

The goal of the package is to allow access to ActiveWorks events as readily as
you would access an ordinary class via an HTTP server and the SOAP protocol.


Setup & Demo Scripts
====================
You must first have the SOAP-Lite and Aw packages installed.  The package has
been tested in an environment where two web servers and three brokers were
running. The servers and brokers must be granted access to the applicable
ports on the applicable systems. 


Prepare Your AW Broker
----------------------
Using the AW 'Event Type Editor' (evtype_editor on Solaris) import the event
definitions from "server/broker-config/soap.data".  This creates the "SOAP"
client group, event scope, SOAP::Request and SOAP::Reply events.  For
demonstration events AdapterDevKit::calcRequest and AdapterDevKit::calcReply
are also added.

Be sure to save the changes on the broker.


Prepare Apache
--------------
Configure Apache for mod_perl to use Apache::AwSOAP as an alternative SOAP
request handler.  Which usually means adding a block like the following to
your conf/http.conf file:


<Location /aw-soap>
  SetHandler    perl-script
  PerlHandler   Apache::AwSOAP
</Location>


And restart Apache :-)


Prepare Your Modules
--------------------
Before running 'perl Makefile.PL' edit lib/SOAP/Transport/ACTIVEWORKS.pm and
update the AW_DEFAULT_* strings for the appropriate broker, host port number
for your site (editing the default client group is probably a bad idea).

After installing the ACTIVEWORKS module with "make install" add the modules
in server/SafeModules to where you keep deployed modules for your SOAP servers.


Start Your Servers!
-------------------
You restarted Apache already right?  Now edit the adapter scripts to talk to
the brokers at your site:

  server/soap-lite-adapter.pl   (the AW SOAP server)
  server/calc-adapter.pl        (for demo only)
  time_adapter.pl               (from the Aw:: pacakge)

and start them.  Edit the client scripts accordingly and have at it.  Each
script contains POD documentation.
